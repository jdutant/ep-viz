title: "Epistemology Vizualized"
---

This is a prototype website for the [*Epistemology Visualized* project](https://github.com/jdutant/ep-viz).

## Aims

The project aims at providing open source, modular, interactive visualizations of important theorms and models in epistemology, starting with political epistemology.

## Example

See the [Condorcet Jury Theorem](topics/condorcet.qmd) page for a prototype.

## Technicalities

* Text: markdown and the occasional LaTeX for maths.
* Code: Javascript for lean and fast in-browser rendering. We could consider Wasm Python through Wasm, but doesn't seem that easy yet.
* Interactive visualizations: [Observable](https://observablehq.com/). Could consider others.
* Document rendering: [Quarto](https://quarto.org).
