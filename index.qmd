title: "Epistemology Vizualized"
---

This is a prototype website for the *Epistemology Visualized* project.

Copyright 2025 Julien Dutant.  

# Aims

The project aims at providing open source, modular, interactive visualizations of important theorms and models in epistemology, starting with political epistemology.

# Example

See the Condorcet Jury Theorem page for a prototype.

# Technicalities

* Text: markdown and the occasional LaTeX for maths.
* Code: Javascript for lean and fast in-browser rendering. We could consider Wasm Python through Wasm, but doesn't seem that easy yet.
* Interactive visualizations: [Observable](https://observablehq.com/). Could consider others.
* Document rendering: [Quarto](https://quarto.org).
