# Technicalities

* Text: markdown and the occasional LaTeX for maths.
* Code: Javascript for lean and fast in-browser rendering. We could consider Wasm Python through Wasm, but doesn't seem that easy yet.
* Interactive visualizations: [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-gallery). Could consider others.
* Document rendering: [Quarto](https://quarto.org).
